## Overview of the Project

### Project: Calculator

### **Objective:** <br>
The objective of this calculator app project is to develop a 
functional web application that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### **Technologies used:** <br>
**1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: For creating the user interface and form elements. <br>
**2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: For styling the user interface to enhance 
its visual appeal and user experience. <br>
**3.Java Servlets**: For handling form submissions, processing input data, 
performing arithmetic operations, and generating dynamic responses. <br>
**4.Apache Tomcat (or another Servlet Container)**: For deploying and running the web application. <br>

### **Project Workflow** <br>
### **User Interaction:** <br>
- The user enters two numbers and selects an arithmetic operation from the dropdown menu. <br>
- On form submission, the data is sent to the CalculatorServlet via a GET request.

### **Servlet Processing:** <br>
- The servlet retrieves the input values and the selected operation. <br>
- It performs the calculation based on the selected operation. <br>
- It handles any potential errors (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero). <br>
- The result displayed using the servlet file. <br>

The calculator app project successfully demonstrates the integration of front-end HTML 
with back-end Java servlets, providing a functional web application that performs basic
arithmetic operations. This project enhances understanding of web development principles, 
including client-server architecture, form handling, and dynamic content generation.
