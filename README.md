Objective:
The objective of this calculator app project is to develop a 
functional web application that performs basic arithmetic operations.

Technologies used:
1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language): For creating the user interface and form elements.
2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) (Optional): For styling the user interface to enhance 
its visual appeal and user experience.
3.Java Servlets: For handling form submissions, processing input data, 
performing arithmetic operations, and generating dynamic responses.
4.Apache Tomcat (or another Servlet Container): For deploying and running the web application.

Project Workflow
User Interaction:
The user enters two numbers and selects an arithmetic operation from the dropdown menu.
On form submission, the data is sent to the CalculatorServlet via a GET request.

Servlet Processing:
The servlet retrieves the input values and the selected operation.
It performs the calculation based on the selected operation.
It handles any potential errors (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).
The result displayed using the servlet file.

The calculator app project successfully demonstrates the integration of front-end HTML 
with back-end Java servlets, providing a functional web application that performs basic
arithmetic operations. This project enhances understanding of web development principles, 
including client-server architecture, form handling, and dynamic content generation.
